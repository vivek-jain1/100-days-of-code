# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 31st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created the trello board and went through a couple of videos of the youtube playlist by Siraj.

**Thoughts:** Looking at the trello board is a bit overwhelming but also motivating at the same time. Siraj's energy has alleviated my interest.

### Day 1: September 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through 11 videos of the Datacamp:Python playlist and solve 5 hackerrank problems on Python.
                      Completed 1st week of ML by Andrew Ng

**Thoughts:** Really liked Andrew's style of teaching. Gave me a real good understanding of Linear Regression in one variable.
