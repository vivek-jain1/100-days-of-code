# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 31st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created the trello board and went through a couple of videos of the youtube playlist by Siraj.

**Thoughts:** Looking at the trello board is a bit overwhelming but also motivating at the same time. Siraj's energy has alleviated my interest.

### Day 1: September 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed 1st week of ML by Andrew Ng
                      Went through 11 videos of the Datacamp:Python playlist 
                      Solved 10 hackerrank problems on Python.
                      Completed third video of Siraj's playlist (Movie recommender)

**Thoughts:** Really liked Andrew's style of teaching. Gave me a real good understanding of Linear Regression in one variable.

### Day 2: September 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2nd week of ML by Andrew Ng with assignment
                      Finished 20 mins of Python crash course on youtube
                      Solved 5 more hackerrank problems on Python.
                       
                      
**Thoughts:** Owing to a decent mathematics background that I have, the topics seemed easy enough. It was good to see some practial use of derivatives.Need to check the derivation of Normal equation. Implementing these exercises in python could be fun

 ### Day 3: September 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3rd week theory of ML by Andrew Ng 
                      Finished Python crash course on youtube
                      Solved 5 more hackerrank problems on Python.
                       
                      
**Thoughts:** Need to check regularisation again

 ### Day 4: September 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed 3rd week assignment of ML by Andrew Ng 
                      Finished Python numpy on youtube
                      Solved 5 more hackerrank problems on Python.
                       
                      
**Thoughts:** This week's assignment felt a little tough. Probably because, I didn't wan't to use for loops for solving the problems. Got confused a little but dug through. I am going faster than I expected. Can't wait to start the Neural networks lecture.
