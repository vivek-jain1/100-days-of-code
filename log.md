# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 31st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created the trello board and went through a couple of videos of the youtube playlist by Siraj.

**Thoughts:** Looking at the trello board is a bit overwhelming but also motivating at the same time. Siraj's energy has alleviated my interest.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
